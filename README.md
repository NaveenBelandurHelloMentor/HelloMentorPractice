# News & Blogs Project

This is a small project built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, and Storybook. The project includes a **Breaking News** component, which contains two buttons and an anchor (`<a>`) tag. We have also integrated Storybook for UI component development and Jest for unit testing.

## Objective
The main objective of this project was to create a small component that simulates a **Breaking News** section, featuring buttons and a link. We added the component to Storybook to visualize its UI in isolation and wrote unit tests using Jest to ensure that the tags (buttons and `<a>` tag) are being rendered correctly.

## Features
- **React**: The app is built with React components.
- **Storybook**: For isolated component development and testing.
- **Jest**: Used for unit testing and validating the correct rendering of the elements.
- **Next.js**: Framework for React-based server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for better development experience.
